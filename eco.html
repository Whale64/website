<h3>Saving our enviorment is more important that ever. Here's Why:</h3>

<h4>1. Rising Heat</h4>

<p>With all the emissions being produced
by everyday items, Our earth is getting
hotter and hotter to the point
where heat waves are now
common than ever! and the intense heat is melting
our ice caps which is making our sea levels rise.
In the near future (100 years) costal cities could flood!
</p>
<h4>2. Natural Resources</h4>

<p>We are cutting down trees and damaging ecosystems, Which could make the climate change even worse! Without trees to clean our atmosphere, we could end up with an overwhelming amount of CO2, which could trap all the heat in.</p>
<h4>3. Extinction Problems</h4>

<p>Because we are ruining ecosystems, many important animals are becoming extinct, which can seriously effect our supply to food. Plants and animals could disappear, which could cause us to run out of food!</p>

<h4>4. How YOU can help</h4>

<p>
1. Pick up trash and put it in a garbage bin.
</p>

<p>
2. Put trash in the proper bin (Cans in recycling, Food in compost, etc.)
</p>

<p>
3. Only use as much water as you need.
</p>

<p>
4. Turn off the lights when you are not in the room.
</p>

<p>
5. Dont peel bark or pull leaves off trees or plants.
